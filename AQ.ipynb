    "#### Optimized Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\mathcal{O}(n^{n+1})$ is a very high time complexity, we looked for an optimized algorithm to solve the problem. In particular we found that:\n",
    "- consider the vector of all marks $p = [p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n]$ to be ordered such that $p_1\\leq p_2\\leq \\dots\\leq p_n$:\n",
    "  - if $n$ is odd then the final mark does not depend on the initial score $S$ and is:  $\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=\\frac{n-1}2+1}^{n}p_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{\\frac{n-1}2}p_j$\n",
    "  - if $n$ is even then the final mark is:  $S + \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=\\frac{n}2+1}^{n}p_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{\\frac{n}2}p_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's simple to show that if $n$ is odd then the final mark does not depend on $S$. In fact Federico, the ficticious student, has to make $n-1$ choices for the exams (the last is dependent on those previous choices). Every $2$ choices $S$ is first added and then subtracted, so it disappears. But $n$ is odd, so $n-1$ is divisible by $2$ and that means that $S$ does not appear in the final score. \n",
    "We say that \"Every $2$ choices $S$ is first added and then subtracted\" because we can (WLOG) look at the following example where $n=3$:\n",
    "- we have $S$ and $p = [p_1, p_2, p_3]$ \n",
    "- choose one of the three arbitrarily, WLOG $p_3$:\n",
    "  - if $S \\geq p_3$ then\n",
    "    - $S^{(1)} = p_3$ and $p = [p_1 + S - p_3, p_2 + S - p_3]$ \n",
    "    \n",
    "      then WLOG we pick $p_2 + S - p_3$\n",
    "    - if $S^{(1)} \\geq p_2 + S - p_3$ \n",
    "\n",
    "      then $S^{(2)} = p_2 + S - p_3$ and $p = [p_1 + S - p_3 + (S^{(1)} - (p_2 + S - p_3))] = [p_1 + S -p_3 +(p_3 - p_2 - S + p_3)] = [p_3 + p_1 - p_2]$ and the final score is $p_3 + p_1 - p_2$ and does not depend on $S$\n",
    "    - if $S^{(1)} < p_2 + S - p_3$ \n",
    "\n",
    "      then $S^{(2)} = p_2 + S - p_3$ and $p = [p_1 + S - p_3 - ((p_2 + S - p_3) - S^{(1)})] = [p_1 + S -p_3 - (p_2 + S - p_3 - p_3)] = [p_3 + p_1 - p_2]$ and the final score is $p_3 + p_1 - p_2$ and does not depend on $S$\n",
    "  - if $S < p_3$ then the final mark is the same, but we omit to write the calculus and all the subcases.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this also follows that in the case of $n$ even then the initial personal score $S$ is summed to the final maximum score because here we have one more choice, that is equivalent to add $S$ to the final result computed considering $S^{(0)} = 0$ and $p = [p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we prove our optimized algorithm using strong induction on the length $n$ of the vector of exams. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $n=1$ the vector of exams is $[p_1]$. Then the final score is $p_1$ and is the maximum obtainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $n=2$ the vector of exams is $[p_1, p_2]$. Let us analyze all the possibilities:\n",
    "- if Federico chooses $p_1$ as the first exam:\n",
    "  - if $S > p_1$: final score = $p_2 + S - p_1$\n",
    "  - if $S \\leq p_1$: final score = $p_2 - p_1 + S$\n",
    "- if Federico chooses $p_2$ as the first exam:\n",
    "  - if $S > p_2$: final score = $p_1 + S - p_2$\n",
    "  - if $S \\leq p_2$: final score = $p_1 - p_2 + S$\n",
    "  \n",
    "So there are only two possibilities for the final score: $p_2-p_1 + S$ to $p_1 - p_2 + S$. Since $p_2 \\geq p_1$ then the maximum final score will be $p_2-p_1 + S$ and follows the rules of our algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "By inductive hypothesis we have that the algorithm is right $\\forall k<n$. Our discussion is divided into two cases, $n$ odd and $n$ even. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $n$ is odd we WLOG assume  that $S^{(0)} = 0$, because we have shown that the final score does not depend on the initial score. We want the last step (when we have only two exams left to choose from) to be to increase the final score, and to do this we must necessarily start by increasing all the exams by as much as possible. We want to increase them all, so Federico must choose as the first exam $p_n$ which has the largest value. By doing this we can increase the remaining exams, which become $p_i^{(1)}= p_i + p_n$ and $S^{(1)} =p_n$.\n",
    "Again, we want to increase the exams values by as much value as possible. Since $S^{(1)} =p_n$ then Federico will have to choose $S^{(2)} =p_1^{(1)}$ since $p_n-p_1^{(1)}$ is the greatest possible difference between our exams. The remaining exams will then become $p_i^{(2)} = p_i^{(1)} + (p_n - p_1^{(1)}) = (p_i + p_n)+(p_n-p_1-p_n) = p_i + p_n - p_1$ and the score $S^{(2)} = p_n - p_1$. But now we can use the inductive hypothesis since we have a vector of votes of length less than $n$. So the final maximum score will be $$S^{(final)} = p_n - p_1 + p_{n-1}-p_2 + \\dots + p_{\\frac{n+3}2} - p_{\\frac{n-1}2} + p_{\\frac{n+1}2} = \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=\\frac{n-1}2+1}^{n}p_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{\\frac{n-1}2}p_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $n$ is even the final score is the score we get considering $S^{(0)} = 0$, plus the original initial score. So we can assume $S^{(0)} = 0$. The treatment is analogous to that in the case of odd $n$ but starting this time by considering $p_1$, and concluding again with the inductive hypothesis.\n",
