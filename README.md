# ADM Homework 3 - Recommendation systems and clustering everywhere!

This repository contains code and analysis for ADM Homework 4.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following key files and folders:

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the homework, including data collection, preprocessing, recommender system, clustering, command line solutions and algorithmic question.

- `CommandLine.sh`: Bash script containing solution for command line question
  
- `clq-output.png`: Output image for the CommandLine question

- `functions.py`: Python module containing the functions used in main solution


## Analysis Summary

The analysis focused on preprocessing the data followed by building a recommendation system using Hashing techniques. Furthermore, feature engineering was done followed by suitable dimensionality reduction techniques and then clustering was done with k-means and k-means ++ implementation. The clustering algorithm was evaluated based on certain metrics like Silhouette Scores.

The repository contains all code and output to replicate the analysis described in the homework.
